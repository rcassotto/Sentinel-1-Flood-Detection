# Sentinel-1-Flood-Detection
Python based tools to detect flood indundation through bimodal thresholding.  The tool uses GRD-derived observations to produce binary flood maps.  It incorporates a geotiff of water extent from the Global Surface Water data set (https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download) by Pekel et al, (2016) to delineate permanent water bodies from ephemeral flooded regions.
